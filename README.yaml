# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform Module to provision a basic IAM user suitable for humans. It will establish a login profile and associate the user with IAM groups. 

  We do not recommend creating IAM users for any other purpose. For external systems (e.g. CI/CD) check out our [`terraform-aws-iam-system-user`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-system-user) module.

# How to use this project
usage: |2-

  First, make sure all users register with [keybase.io](https://keybase.io) to faciliate public key encryption (PKE). 
  Then use their keybase username to automatically encrypt their AWS secret. It's that easy!


  ```hcl
  module "jack" {
    source = "cloudposse/iam-user/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"
    name       = "jack"
    user_name  = "jack@companyname.com"
    pgp_key    = "keybase:jack"
    groups     = ["admins"]
  }
  ```
  __NOTE:__ We recommend using email addresses for IAM user accounts.

examples: |-
  ```hcl
  module "jill" {
    source = "cloudposse/iam-user/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"
    name      = "jill"
    user_name  = "jill@companyname.com"
    pgp_key    = "keybase:jill"
    groups    = ["engineering"]
  }
  ```
