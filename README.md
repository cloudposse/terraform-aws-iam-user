# terraform-aws-iam-user [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform Module to provision a basic IAM user suitable for humans. It will establish a login profile and associate the user with IAM groups. 

We do not recommend creating IAM users for any other purpose. For external systems (e.g. CI/CD) check out our [`terraform-aws-iam-system-user`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-system-user) module.


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).










## Usage


First, make sure all users register with [keybase.io](https://keybase.io) to faciliate public key encryption (PKE). 
Then use their keybase username to automatically encrypt their AWS secret. It's that easy!


```hcl
module "jack" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user.git?ref=master"
  name       = "jack"
  pgp_key    = "keybase:jack"
  groups     = ["admins"]
}
```
__NOTE:__ We recommend using email addresses for IAM user accounts.




## Examples

```hcl
module "jill" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user.git?ref=master"
  name      = "jill"
  pgp_key    = "keybase:jill"
  groups    = ["engineering"]
}
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| enabled | Whether to create the IAM user | string | `true` | no |
| force_destroy | When destroying this user, destroy even if it has non-Terraform-managed IAM access keys, login profile or MFA devices. Without force_destroy a user with non-Terraform-managed access keys and login profile will fail to be destroyed. | string | `false` | no |
| groups | List of IAM user groups this user should belong to in the account | list | `<list>` | no |
| login_profile_enabled | Whether to create IAM user login profile | string | `true` | no |
| name | Desired name for the IAM user. We recommend using email addresses. | string | - | yes |
| password_length | The length of the generated password | string | `24` | no |
| password_reset_required | Whether the user should be forced to reset the generated password on first login. | string | `true` | no |
| path | Desired path for the IAM user | string | `/` | no |
| permissions_boundary | The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the user | string | `` | no |
| pgp_key | Provide a base-64 encoded PGP public key, or a keybase username in the form `keybase:username`. Required to encrypt password. | string | - | yes |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| keybase_password_decrypt_command | Command to decrypt the Keybase encrypted password |
| keybase_password_pgp_message | PGP encrypted message (e.g. suitable for email exchanges) |
| pgp_key | PGP key used to encrypt sensitive data for this user |
| user_arn | The ARN assigned by AWS for this user |
| user_login_profile_encrypted_password | The encrypted password, base64 encoded |
| user_login_profile_key_fingerprint | The fingerprint of the PGP key used to encrypt the password |
| user_name | IAM user name |
| user_unique_id | The unique ID assigned by AWS |
