# terraform-aws-iam-user [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform Module to provision a basic IAM user suitable for humans. It will establish a login profile and associate the user with IAM groups. 

We do not recommend creating IAM users for any other purpose. For external systems (e.g. CI/CD) check out our [`terraform-aws-iam-system-user`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-system-user) module.


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).










## Usage


First, make sure all users register with [keybase.io](https://keybase.io) to faciliate public key encryption (PKE). 
Then use their keybase username to automatically encrypt their AWS secret. It's that easy!


```hcl
module "jack" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user.git?ref=master"
  name       = "jack"
  pgp_key    = "keybase:jack"
  groups     = ["admins"]
}
```
__NOTE:__ We recommend using email addresses for IAM user accounts.




## Examples

```hcl
module "jill" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user.git?ref=master"
  name      = "jill"
  pgp_key    = "keybase:jill"
  groups    = ["engineering"]
}
```
